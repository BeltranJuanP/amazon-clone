This is a clone of the Amazon storepage.

https://amazon-clone-seven-iota.vercel.app

Tech Used:
Javascript, Next.js (SSR), React.js, TailwindCSS, Redux, NextAuth.js, Stripe

TODO:
- better sign out UI
- website demo
- add similar items to product page
- expand the product database to include things like prime and rating
- add quantity to cart
- on objects with prime there shouldn't be any shipping cost
- shopping cart sign in to checkout loses all the items in the cart
- clean up the website by maybe adding some animations
- cant access success without success


Notes:
command for local testing -> stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
